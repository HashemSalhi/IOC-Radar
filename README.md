# Bulk-IOC-Scanner

A web tool for SOC analysts to bulk-scan Indicators of Compromise — file hashes, IP
addresses, domains, and URLs — against threat intelligence providers (VirusTotal & AbuseIPDB).

## Features

- **Bulk scanning** — paste many IOCs at once (newline or comma separated)
- **File scanning** — files are hashed locally (MD5/SHA1/SHA256); only the hash is sent out
- **Auto type detection** — hashes, IPs, domains, URLs (handles defanged IOCs too)
- **Risk scoring** — 0–100 score, color-coded Low / Medium / High
- **History, tagging, CSV export, and copy-ready investigation reports**
- **API keys** configurable right in the UI — no file editing needed
